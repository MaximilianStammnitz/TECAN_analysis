TECAN-reader based yeast growth measurements in R
=================================================

[Maxi's script](./TECAN_384_well.R) and some [toy data](./TECAN_growths.xlsx) for calculating maximum yeast growth rates from 384-well TECAN measurements, in R. Additionally, [Aina's script](./recovery_data_script.R) can be used to recover run data from the system's output log files â€“ the only access to the measurements in case the excel sheet is closed and not saved during the run (...usually by another user...).

```
R --version
```

The current R version is also shown when opening RStudio or the R Console. Script requires the following R packages: [**`readxl`**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html), [**`growthrates`**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/growthrates/index.html).

Although care has been taken to make the code distribution-independent, it is possible that some of the scripts only work on Unix/MacOS systems, and may need to be modified in order to run on Windows systems.
